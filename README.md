# GPA Calculation Project

The (current) goal is to "Design and implement a means of computing GPA per section and per group. GPA is based on university definitions found in the catalogue under Grading Policies. A grade of “F” awards no points but is incorporated into GPA. Grades of “I”, “W”, “P”, “NP” award no points and are not incorporated into GPA"
